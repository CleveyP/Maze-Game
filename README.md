# Maze-Game
c++ terminal game where player tries to find the door out of the maze
This is a game modeled on find your hat terminal game. Check this out for reference https://github.com/eloygplaza/find-your-hat
However, this game is going to be better! We are going to implement more features than just finding a hat. For instance, we want to make sure that the maze is solvable
We want to add the possibility of encountering a monster. (I dont know what this will mean yet but maybea turn based fight sequence against monster)
We are going to add a player inventory (so item classes etc. )and multiple levels. We are going to recruit people from the comic club to do our terminal art for us. 
We are going to create a save feature where the player inventory, current maze level, current player level, health etc will be stored to a local file. 
I am open to other ideas as well of course on how to make this game beyond awesome!
